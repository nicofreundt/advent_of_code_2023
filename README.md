# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions for the AoC puzzles of 2023.

Advent of Code is an annual online event that combines programming challenges with a unique holiday-themed storyline. Created by Eric Wastl in 2015, it runs every December from the 1st to the 25th, offering participants a daily coding puzzle to solve. The challenges vary in difficulty and cover a wide range of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.
